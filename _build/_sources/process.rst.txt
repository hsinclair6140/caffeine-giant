Process
=======

Many believe that the game development process includes three major phases: Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production. (YoYo Games, n.d.) shows the production lifecycle as containing seven, saying only having three phases as a bit of an oversimplification. At |Studio|, we follow this seven-stage process.

Planning
--------
As the very first stage of the development lifecycle, the Planning phase is where the foundation is created. In this phase, we answer all of the critical questions for the game, such as the genre of the game, the artistic styling, story, game engine, mechanics, etc. These are the fundamentals that should be determined before any development takes place, as making changes to these fundamentals after development starts can be very costly. 

In the Planning phase, we will also produce a proof of concept. The proof of concept is useful for understanding the time it will take to develop the project, the cost, the skills needed, and much more. It also gives a chance to demo to the game to interested parties.

Pre-Production
--------------

(Stefyn, 2022) states that, "This is where every project begins. Essentially, Pre-Production defines what the game is about, why it should be made, and what itâ€™s going to take to make it."
