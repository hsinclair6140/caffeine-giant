Automated Testing
-----------------
Achieving a high-level of test coverage through automated testing helps to create robust code early in development and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs into software in later stages of development. While not always feasible, automated tests should be written when it makes sense. 

Reduction of Code Complexity
----------------------------
Having a goal of simple code makes the code easier to maintain and reduces the likelihood of bugs. 

Iterative Deliverables
----------------------
Each development cycle involves a properly scoped change, either a feature addition of a bug fix. Upon completion of each change, the project should be built and possibly delivered. 

Unreal Engine

To remain consistent and to allow multiple developers to quickly pick up an existing project, strive to follow the style guide below:
